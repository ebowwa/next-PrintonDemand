/** 
 * app/layout.tsx currently uses the client but could probably use a more 
 * thoughtout amalgomation of the client and the middlewear
 * 
Combining Both Approaches:
Complementary Functionality: You can use both snippets together to achieve a comprehensive solution. The middleware ensures that each user has a unique client ID, which is then used by the client-side code to send accurate analytics data to Google Analytics.

Full-Stack Integration: This combination provides a full-stack approach to integrating Google Analytics, leveraging both server-side and client-side capabilities.

Example Usage:
Middleware Setup: First, set up the middleware as shown in Code Snippet 2. This ensures that every request has a properly managed _ga cookie.

Client-Side Integration: Then, integrate the client-side component from Code Snippet 1 into your application. This component will use the _ga cookie set by the middleware to send analytics data to Google Analytics.
